### Update 3/29/2016

I've begun re-writing the entire program as a Windows App.  Not really my choice.  It seems the BluetoothLE API Microsoft has thrown together (for-real-doh, it's super bad) is most easily adopted under the Windows Universal App toolchain.

Anyway, here's the resting space of the new projects

### Lumi for Desktop
Where I come from they having a saying: "Video or it didn't happen."  I've always liked that saying.  It means we have to put our work where our typing is.   Here is a video of the uploader I wrote to interface with the TinySafeBoot AVR two-wire (UART) bootloader.  


It was written with the idea a serial connection could be directly opened from the computer using Bluetooth 4.0.  Or, if we get super fancy, using WiFi.  On the receiving end, connected to the AVR, would be an HM-10 or an ESP8266 respectively.  This would allow direct wireless uploading of Arduino sketches (or Atmel studio hex files) to the targeted Arduino (or AVR, if you will).

It has a couple of kinks, but I'm fairly pleased with it.

The whole projects is named after my friend Lumi who passed away last year.  Amazing man with good taste in photography subjects. :)

## Churning Data into Information
I work with a lot of data on the behalf of an agency without a lot of money.  Exploring free-to-use and open-source tools is key to being effective in my job.

Recently, I've written a a couple of series on how to use R and SQL to sort through Homeless Management Information System data.  

* [HMIS, R, and SQL](https://ladvien.com/hmis-r-sql-introduction/)
* [HMIS SQL-R Script Snippets](https://ladvien.com/attachment-iii-aka-the-zombie/)

These data are essential to local governments helping individuals experiencing homelessness to be housed quickly and appropriately.

But one area R and SQL have not delivered is on-line interactive dashboards.  Data is one thing, but easy to digest information is really key to informing stakeholders how the system is working to end homelessness.

In other projects I've attempted to generate graphs as images and upload to a static link.  Then, each time the data change re-generate replace the image.  But, most website servers cache the images so it is not ideal.

This has pushed me to try to learn D3.

* [D3.js](https://d3js.org/)

I'm not going to lie, I've felt confused by languages, IDEs, and libraries.  And I've overcome most of the these challenges.  But I've never been so confused as by the layout and syntax of D3. The dyslexic feeling I get trying to work in D3 has discouraged me from spending too much time on it.

But recently I decided to take another stab at it-- this time I lucked out and found the C3.js.

* [C3.js](http://c3js.org/)

Essentially, C3 is a library which _greatly_ simplifies D3.  It boils down building a graph into a simple options passed to the C3 graph builder as a JSON object.

This code:

{% highlight javascript %}
var chart = c3.generate({
    data: {
        x: 'Date',
        y: '# Individuals',
        xFormat: '%Y-%m-%d',
        url: 'https://ladvien.com/projects/d3/data/trendsInTX601.csv',
        type: 'line',
        // colors: {
        //     Count: '#990000'
        // }
        names: {
            NumberHomeless: "Homeless",
            NumberInRRH: "Rapid Rehousing",
            NumberInPSH: "Permanent Supportive Housing"
        }
    },
    
    title: {
        text: "Homeless or Formerly Homeless in TX-601"
    },

    legend: {
        show: true
    },

    axis: {
        x: {
            type: 'timeseries',
            tick: {
                count: 4,
                format: '%Y-%m-%d',
                // rotate: 90,
                multiline: false,
                
                culling: {
                    max:5 
                }
            }
        },
        y: {
            max: 3000,
            min: 0,
            label: "# Individuals"
            // Range includes padding, set 0 if no padding needed
            // padding: {top:0, bottom:0}
        },
    },
    
    point: {
        r: 0
    }
});
{% endhighlight %}

Using this CSV:

* [trendsInTX601.csv](https://ladvien.com/projects/d3/data/trendsInTX601.csv)

Produces the following graph: 
<link href="https://ladvien.com/projects/d3/practice/c3-0.4.15/c3.css" rel="stylesheet">  
<script src="https://d3js.org/d3.v3.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://ladvien.com/projects/d3/practice/c3-0.4.15/c3.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://ladvien.com/projects/d3/tx-601/trends-tx-601.js"></script>
<div id="chart"></div>


## One Hiccup

I did run into a few hiccups in setup.  First, it seems the most recent version of d3 (version 4.0) has had much of its API overhauled.  In such, it will not work with C3.  But D3 v3 is still available from the D3 CDN:

{% highlight js %}
<script src="https://d3js.org/d3.v3.min.js"></script>
{% endhighlight %}

Calling this library and following the instructions outlined by the C3 site, you can be generating graphs in little time.

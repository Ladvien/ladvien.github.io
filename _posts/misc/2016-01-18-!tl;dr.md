## Realization

It has hit me recently one reason I am bloggin less is I am writing too much in one article.  For example, I recently documented a project where the wordcount was 4183 words!  Really, would anyone read that?  I wouldn't.

New goal.  I'm going to try and start making my posts 500 words or less.  Maybe I'll add a dynamic plot here later; plot my frequency of writing against how many words in each article.  Hmm.  We'll see.

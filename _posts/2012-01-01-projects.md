# Prioritization Strategy
I've tons of projects.  Too many.  Ironically, I'm a goal oriented person.  I thrive on completing something cool. And as I get older I begin to realize, time is my greatest enemy.  I don't have the time I need to complete as many projects as I scheme.  Here is my attempt to reign in the number of projects, choosing to focus on what matters.

## What Matters
Here are things which matter to me.

* Family
* Interest
* Kudos
* Learning
* Helping Others
* Lolz

## Definition of "Done"

![](https://ladvien.com/images/1b1_frame.jpg){: .float-left} Not too long ago there was a post on Hackaday about a little four-wheeled bot made with a Raspberry Pi and some eBay motor drivers.

I really liked the little chassis, ordered one, and was happy to find it was delivered with the motors already mounted.  (As I become an aged hacker, it's the little time savers which are genuinely appreciated).

On buying the chassis I'd already decided to use one my Raspberry Pi Zero W's (rp0w) to control the bot.  I really like Arch Linux on the rp0w.  It's light weight enough and the packages are well curated.  Again, it's the little time savers.  I liked the combination even more since I found a way to set the rp0w headlessly, which meant I could go from SD card to SSH'ing into little Linux board.

Coincidentally, I purchased several DRV8830 modules from eBay.  This is a sad story -- I've played with the DRV8830 chip a long time ago:

* [Kobold](https://ladvien.com/kobold/)

 Because Sparkfun did a great job of documenting the IC and creating an Arduino library to go with it.  Sadly, I was surprised to find Sparkfun and EOL'ed the boards.

* [MiniMoto Boards](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/retired/11890)

Probably because buttholes like me kept buying them off eBay.  I've got some mixed feelings here -- one of them is guilt.

Anyway, I was surprised to find the mounting holes on the DRV8830s matched up to two sets on the little chassis.

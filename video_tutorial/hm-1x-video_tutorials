      3. Datasheets
      4. Firmware upgrades
    A. Where to buy?
      1. Fasttech
      2. eBay pre-Breakout
    B. Breakout board (show soldering video)
    B. Wiring up to UART-to-USB
    B. Powering Up
    B. Interacting using a Serial Terminal
      1. No Carriage Return or Line Feed after AT
    B. Baud, Stop Bits, Parity
    B. AT+RESET after to make sure commands take
    B. AT+RENEW Resets to factory firmware
    C. Central and Slave
    B. "Oh Crap!" Hardware Reset
II. HM-1X and PIO Fun I
  1. HM-10's PIO pins and their abilities (ADC, PWM, H/L)
  2. HM-11's PIO pins and their abilities (H/L)
  3. Reminder of current sink / source limits.
  4. Special pins (Refer to page 17 of HM manual)
    A. System LED
    B. System KEY
  4. AT+PIO send pins high, low.
  5. AT+PIO set PWM of pin
  6. AT+ADC read ADC of pin
  11. AT+PIO1 -- Set System LED pin behavior
III. HM-1X and PIO Fun II
  7. AT+BEFC pin state after power on -- use bit calculator
  8. AT+AFTC pin state after connection -- use bit calculator.
  9. AT+COL? Get pin status in 12 bits -- use bit calculator.
  10. AT+CYC Set the pin collection rate (00-99 seconds)
    A. HM will send pin state every X seconds in the form of, "OK+Col:0xFFF"
IV. Remote module

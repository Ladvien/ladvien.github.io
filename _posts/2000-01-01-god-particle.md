### God created the world perfect, we fucked it up
Why does bad shit happen in the world?  

Take someone makes a choice to heroine.  It doesn't take more than a few times to make a habit.  Then it becomes an addiction. Now, a person has less free will.  But mroe than that, the world is a worse place because of the choice.  There are drug dealers who provide and cops who are disgruntled at dealing with it.

Even if the world was made perfect, we've fucked it up--because we have freewill to do so.


### The Hidden God

Why does god remain hidden?  It is necessary for freewill and reason to coexist.  If a reasonable human saw God in fullest, there is no longer freewill.  The only choices which make sense are those which align with his omnipotent will.

## Doubting Thomas

This letter isn't for you.  If you're an aethist, it'll piss you off.  If you are a Christian, it'll piss you off.  If you are a spiritualist, it'll piss you off. If you are agonostic, well, I'm not sure--it depends how open minded you are.


## Can you doubt yourself?

Nor must we overlook the probability of the constant inculcation in a belief in God on the minds of children producing so strong and perhaps an inherited effect on their brains not yet fully developed, that it would be as difficult for them to throw off their belief in God, as for a monkey to throw off its instinctive fear and hatred of a snake.

### Doubt is a skill

* Dillusional battles a good source of practice.
* Schizophrenic man being able to doubt his reality

1. Vehement reaction to an idea is ofte an in indicator of non-reason
2. Dissonance bias and consance bias
3. Understading others Vehemence
    * Believe you will go to hell
    * Believe you will confine the world with abusive morality (aka, witch trials)
4. Philosophy is a house of cards
5. Staked facts have little use

## C.S. Lewis on Time

http://www2.esm.vt.edu/~sdross/text/beyondtime.html

    If you picture Time as a straight line along which we have to travel, then you must picture as the whole page on which the line is drawn. We come to the parts of the line one by one: we have to leave A behind before we get to B, and cannot reach C until we leave B behind. God, from above or outside or all around, contains the whole line, and sees it all.

## Sigmound Brower -- Evolution

### Darwin on God
With respect to the theological view of the question; this is always painful to me.— I am bewildered.– I had no intention to write atheistically. But I own that I cannot see, as plainly as others do, & as I [should] wish to do, evidence of design & beneficence on all sides of us. There seems to me too much misery in the world. I cannot persuade myself that a beneficent & omnipotent God would have designedly created the Ichneumonidæ with the express intention of their feeding within the living bodies of caterpillars, or that a cat should play with mice. Not believing this, I see no necessity in the belief that the eye was expressly designed. On the other hand I cannot anyhow be contented to view this wonderful universe & especially the nature of man, & to conclude that everything is the result of brute force. I am inclined to look at everything as resulting from designed laws, with the details, whether good or bad, left to the working out of what we may call chance. Not that this notion at all satisfies me. I feel most deeply that the whole subject is too profound for the human intellect. A dog might as well speculate on the mind of Newton.— Let each man hope & believe what he can.

## Higgs-Boson
0. Infinite root-cause analysis
1. Incomplete physics theory without Higgs-Boson

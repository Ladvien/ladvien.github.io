As I prepare to start adding peripherals to my Pi Bot, I wanted to be sure to get around the 700ma power budget the Pi has.  After searching for a cheap battery powered USB hub and finding little, I decided to hack up a few cheap(ish) parts and make my own.

1. [USB Hub](http://www.ebay.com/itm/Black-MINI-4-PORT-USB-1-1-HUB-Full-SPEED-For-LAPTOP-PC-/330784596118?pt=US_USB_Cables_Hubs_Adapters&hash=item4d044c6096): $1.39

2. [5000mAh Battery](http://www.fasttech.com/products/0/10003353/1248700-solar-powered-5000mah-mobile-power-battery-wcharge): $17.93

3. [DC-DC Converter](http://www.fasttech.com/products/0/10002934/1219202-dc-dc-3v-to-5-9v-2a-boost-diy-mobile-phone-power-s): $2.76

Total: $22.08

**The Battery Hack:**

**1. Crack it open.**

**2. Find POWER and GND.**

**3. Wire it up.**

**4. Make a small hole for wires and bring wires out.**

**5. Solder the respective leads to the DC-DC converter.**

**6. Smile, then sit through my _way too long_ of a video to make it into the HUB.**

Hope all are well. :)

**NOTE: Regarding the error at the end of the video.  Don't panic (that's what I did).  I actually found out this had nothing to do with my hub, it had to do with plugging an iPhone into a Raspberry Pi.**

**NOTE2: I realize I used the wrong "hearty," my brain has problems typing homonyms and parahomonyms. :P**

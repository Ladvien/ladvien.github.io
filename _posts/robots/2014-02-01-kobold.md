Awhile back Sparkfun posted a new product, their [MiniMoto](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11890) breakout board.  It breaks out the [DRV8830](http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/slvsab2f/slvsab2f.pdf) IC, which is a serially controlled (I2C) H-Bridge.  I thought the chip was nifty.  A few problems though,

1.  Sparkfun's breakout was 25x25mm for _one_ bridge.  If I added another and then an Arduino Pro Mini it'd lose smallness.
2.  It's $9.95
3.  It's not on a purple board :)

So, I set out to make a robot controller with it that was smaller than a Sparkfun breakout.  What I ended up with is a little bitch I refer to a Kobold.

The board is pretty straightforward.  It has an ATtiny 85 that acts as an I2C Master using the [SoftI2CMaster](http://todbot.com/blog/2010/09/25/softi2cmaster-add-i2c-to-any-arduino-pins/) library.  This allows the Tiny 85 to control two motors using only two pins, leaving three for your pleasure.  

My end goal will be to build a shield for it and hook up a HM-10 to make it a little wireless tethered bot.  This would bring me down to one pin, which I'm sure will be some sort of range finder or feeling sensor.

The BOM:

1.  [1 x ATtiny 85 SOIC](http://www.mouser.com/Search/ProductDetail.aspx?R=ATTINY85-20SHvirtualkey55650000virtualkey556-ATTINY85-20SH) $1.21
2.  [2 x DRV8830 MSOP-10](http://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Texas-Instruments/DRV8830DGQ/?qs=sGAEpiMZZMuJc9I8Ed1ELBR0nLBayH7B) $5.10
3.  [2 x .33 Ohm 0402](http://www.mouser.com/Search/ProductDetail.aspx?R=SR731ELTER330Fvirtualkey66000000virtualkey660-SR731ELTPR330F) $.86
4.  1 x 1uF 0402
5.  2 x 4.7k Res. 0402
6.  [1 x Kobold PCB](http://www.oshpark.com/shared_projects/NCVym4Uc) $2.50 (for three)

**Total: $9.76**

The board can be programmed with an Arduino ISP:

Now, I just need to make a robot with it :)

I'm currently working on a second iteration to correct some problems.  I'll also add a few features, like my pogo-pin programming interface.  The shield I have designed for it will also include a charging circuit and probably a SMD step-up circuit that should convert a LiPo to a nice 5v.  

Anyway, work in progress...just thought I'd share.  

**If anyone is interested in this board, please wait a few iterations. I get worried I'm making blue-smoke with someone else's money.  :)**

Here is the code running in the video:

# Prioritization Strategy
I've tons of projects.  Too many.  Ironically, I'm a goal oriented person.  I thrive on completing something cool. And as I get older I begin to realize, time is my greatest enemy.  I don't have the time I need to complete as many projects as I scheme.  Here is my attempt to reign in the number of projects, choosing to focus on what matters.

Here's what matters to me:

###  Family
My family matter most.  This is complicated, because my brain needs breaks from them.  But if there is a project which will enable engagement with my family, it should take priority.

### Interest
Part of the reason I'm in this project swamp is my natural curiousity.  I'm largely a determinist.  I believe what you do, regardlesss of your initial interest level, will eventually become interesting.  

### Learning
I once wrote in a college essay: "If you're not learning, you're dying."  Still not sure of the veracity of the statement, but I've lived by it since writing it.  I've fallen in love with learning--I want to make sure the projects I work on are actually helping me learn.  Not actions to grind through an activity.

### Kudos
Being real, I like when people think my work is interesting.  The longer I spend in the development world, the more I realize this is pretty universal among good developers.  They care about what they produce and enjoy when someone appreciates it.

### Helping Others
I don't know a lot, but I know people have absolute worth.  Human beings, regardless if they are spiritual vessels or evolutionary by products, are absolutely amazing.  I enjoy getting opportunities to help others.

### Lolz
I see value in walking an unbeaten path.  Creating projects which have little value to others, but bring me joy, are worth working on to me.

### Automation

### The Dream

For awhile now I've dreamt of a PCB which would have everything I need on it: uC, H-bridges, PSU, Lipo charger, inductive power collector, _and_ a wirelesss device which would allow wireless uploading to the uC.  

A lot of failed attempts, some as long as writing my own uploader for the LPC1114, others as "simple" as hacking away at the Arduino IDE source.  However, I finally found a winning combination: TinySafeBoot, Arduino IDE, and most Atmega and ATtiny Atmel chips.

### TinySafeBoot

TinySafeBoot is a pretty neat GPL project which is around 500 bytes.  It allows for selecting of any two pins as RX / TX for two-wire communication.  Or! It has a one-wire protocol.

[TinySafeBoot](http://jtxp.org/tech/tinysafeboot_en.htm)

The part which makes TSB such a great choice for wireless bootloading is its serial communication protocol.  Unlike the hardware protocol Arduino uses, serial communication allows the remote device to control the bootloaders workflow without flipping any hardware pins.  Contrast this against the Arduino bootloader (I think it's optiboot now?) which focuses on resetting the device repeatedly to activate the bootloader.

The hardware doesn't work well is there is no quick way to flip pins on my focused (cheap) wireless devices, the HM-1X and ESP8266.  This means the remote device will have difficulty putting the target uC into bootloader mode.

Of course, TSB has other great features like auto-bauding and password protection, etc.  It's not perfect, but I like it for its simplicity.

### Getting TSB Setup

I have tested TSB on three devices, the ATtiny85, ATmega328P, and ATtiny1634.  _However, I've also tested on an ATtiny1634 which didn't work._

There are two parts to TSB,

1. Firmware
2. [Software](http://jtxp.org/tech/tinysafeboot_en.htm)

However, we are going to only download the software since it allows you to generate "custom" firmware for whatever chip you are targeting.

From here on I will be demonstrating getting TSB going on an ATtiny85.

#### ISP

First, you will need an AVR ISP.  Long ago I bought an AVR-ISP MKII which I used in combination with Atmel Studio 7.  This will allow us to burn the bootloader and set the fuses.  If you do not have an official AVR-ISP you can use AVR-Dude through the Arduino IDE.  You can also use an Arduino as an ISP programmer.

So, either,

1. [AVR ISP MKII](http://www.atmel.com/tools/AVRISPMKII.aspx)
2. [Atmel Studio 7](http://www.atmel.com/Microsite/atmel-studio/)

Or

1. [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)
2. [Arduino Uno ISP](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/ArduinoISP)

Either way, once you have your ISP setup you will connect it to the ATtiny85 like,

Notice the RX / TX will.  They are not part of the ISP.  They will be our bootloader's TX / RX pins when the bootloader has been burnt.

#### Bootloader Creation

Now, to generate the bootloader.

If you haven't, download the software, extract it to a workspace, and open that workspace in the command-line.  The TSB software is CLI only.

Now enter the following,

`C:\TSB_workspace>tsb tn85 b3b4`

TSB then should generate a hex file titled something like,

`tsb_tn85_b3b4_20150826.hex`

This hex file will be our bootloader customized for our particular AVR, the ATtiny85.

To breakdown the TSB command,

* `tn85` tells the TSB SW you are looking to install this firmware on an ATtiny85. If you need to look up a chip code you can find it in a file in the TSB workspace titled "devices.txt"
* `b3b4` tells the TSB SW you want to use PB3 as RX and PB4 as TX.  I chose these as pins since they are not being used by the ISP.  _Note_, having the ISP and UART connected to the same pins _will_ cause problems.

#### Bootloader Burning

To burn the newly generated bootloader you will need to have your ISP connected to the ATtiny85.  First, check the fuses of your chip.  You need to have the following fuses set according to the TSB website,

_ATtinys:_
* SELFPRGEN must be set to enable flash writes from firmware, e.g. TSB
* BODLEVEL should be set to avoid flash corruption during unsafe device power-up.
*LOCKBITS may be set to MODE 3 for enhanced security (i.e. serious password protection intended).

_ATmegas:_
* BOOTRST activated lets the MCU jump into the Bootloader Section (rather than $0000) with every hardware Reset.
* BODLEVEL should be set to avoid flash corruption during unsafe device power-up.
* BOOTSZ=10 or BOOTSZ=11 to reserve 512 bytes for a Bootloader Section.
* BLB to MODE 2 or 3 protects Bootloader Section from undesirable write access by firmware.
* LOCKBITS may be set to Mode 3 (LB-Mode 3) in a security environment.

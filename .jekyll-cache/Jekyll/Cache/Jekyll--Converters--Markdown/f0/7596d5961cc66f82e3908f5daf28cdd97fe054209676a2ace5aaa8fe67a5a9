<p>I’ve waited to finish incorporating my Raspberry Pi into my bot for an ample bit.  But since I know so little about electricity, I swore to myself I wouldn’t add my Pi to my <a href="http://letsmakerobots.com/node/35922">bot </a>until I was absolutely sure I wouldn’t fry it.</p>

<p>Well, I’m still not “absolutely” sure, but I feel this little optoisolator has brought me a lot closer.  This builds on <a href="http://letsmakerobots.com/node/36672">my post</a> a week or so ago about making Eagle parts.</p>

<p>I plan to actually list out what tweaks a Wheezy image needs to get this optoisolator build to work.  It’s actually pretty easy–but whatever you, don’t be lured in by quick2wire.  Those buggers wasted most of my day :(</p>

<p>If anyone has questions let me know.</p>

<p><strong>Oh, one note.  When I populated the board I used 4.7k resistors on the Arduino side, but I pulled off everything on the Raspberry Pi side.  It seems the Pi has built in pull-ups that do the job rather well.</strong></p>

<p>Hope everyone is well :)</p>

## SQL Case
The SQL `CASE` function is one of my favorite.  The command basically works like if-then command.  If you are familiar with if-then commands, then feel free to skip this next bit.

### If-Then
One of the reasons we have the amazing devices we do today is because a computer is capable of reasoning.  A computer can compare two things and decide which one it likes.

Now, this may sound simple, but at its core it is not.  And anyone who has been stuck on the toothpaste isle trying to decide between the 45 kinds of toothpaste probably understands making decisions is difficult.  Of course, human decision making and computer decision making are not even on the same level.  Humans can make decisions about one product in 45 all at once.  Computers, they have to make a decision between two objects, then, two objects, then two objects, so forth, until it has made it through all 45.  Let's take a look.

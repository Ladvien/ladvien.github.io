I"i<p>I‚Äôve used Jekyll to create my website.  A lot of the heavy lifting was done by <a href="https://mademistakes.com/about/">Michael Rose</a> in the form of a Jekyll theme he created called Hpstr.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://mademistakes.com/work/hpstr-jekyll-theme/">Hpstr</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Much respect.</p>

<p>But, setup was pretty painful for me.  I knew nothing about websites, let alone creating a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_web_page">static page website</a>. I‚Äôve decided to set my hand to journal a lot of the nuances I ran into.  Try to save someone some time.  Or, save myself some time when something goes wrong.</p>

<p>These articles will not be on CSS, JavaScript, or HTML.  After tinkering with computers for 20 years, I still suck at CSS and HTML‚Äìno, there are much better resources on the matter.</p>

<p>I actually recommend spending $30 on the following Udemy courses.  They are great courses and will get you everything you need to be competitive.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.udemy.com/design-and-develop-a-killer-website-with-html5-and-css3">Build Responsive Real World Websites with HTML5 and CSS3</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-javascript-course/">The Complete JavaScript Course 2018: Build Real Projects!</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.udemy.com/linux-mastery/">Linux Mastery</a></li>
</ul>

<p>(Note, make sure to get them on sale.  Second note, they go on sale a lot.)</p>

<p>I‚Äôm not getting a kick back from Udemy, I list these courses because they are the ones I‚Äôve taken and will vouch they are great courses to with this guide series.</p>

<h2 id="1-orientation">1. Orientation</h2>

<p>A lot of other articles will recommend setting up Jekyll locally, building your site to perfection, then get a rent a server when you have the time.  I <em>don‚Äôt</em> recommend going this route.</p>

<p>In one way it makes sense to get a feel for Jekyll before deploying.  You aren‚Äôt paying money while you learn.  But, building a Jekyll site out locally, with all the bells and whistles, may cause a lot of problems deploying it.  Was it the 5th gem or the 12th gem which is causing problems?  No, I found it‚Äôs better to go for broke and start building the site on the web.</p>

<p>A couple of reasons I prefer my workflow.</p>

<p>First, the psychological payoff doesn‚Äôt happen until the gross stuff is out of the way.  Setting up the server side is tedious and can be boring.  But, it is necessary for your site to be up and running on your own server.  The payoff being when your site is available to your buddy in Maine who can see the friggin awesome site you‚Äôve built.</p>

<p>If you put the kudos and warm fuzzies at the beginning, meaning, you deploy your site locally and tell yourself how great it looks, it robs you have the drive needed to trudge through the server side setup.  Science!</p>

<p>Second, there are many different variables to account for between your local machine and the server.  For example, if you are building Jekyll from a Windows machine and serving it on Ubuntu there can often be dependency differences which you must troubleshoot.  Best to start doing it right away (see first point).</p>

<p>Ok, have I persuaded you?  No?  Then why are you still reading? Ha!</p>

<p>Also, the one thing you‚Äôll have setting up the server side I did not is this guide.  I plan to setup a new site walking while writing these articles to assure this guide is relevant.  But if I miss anything, I‚Äôm available to help in the comments.  It makes my day to save someone some development time.</p>

<h2 id="2-choose-a-server-provided">2. Choose a Server Provided</h2>
<p>Ever rented a server before? I hadn‚Äôt either.</p>

<p>Here is my tip sheet laden with my opinion.</p>

<h4 id="a-dont-go-flashy">a. Don‚Äôt Go Flashy</h4>
<p>I don‚Äôt recommend going with a flashy name.  E.g, GoDaddy, HostGator, etc.  The general rule is, if they are pushy with their marketing they probably aren‚Äôt a solid choice.</p>

<p>The two solid choices right now are
    * <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">Digital Ocean</a>
    * <a href="https://www.linode.com/">Linode</a></p>

<h4 id="b-go-with-linux">b. Go with Linux</h4>
<p>Oh! And go with Linux!</p>

<p>I had a CEO one time who forced me to use Windows on our server.  Man, it was a flop.</p>

<p>First, Windows back-ends aren‚Äôt well documented on the web.  They cost more.  There are fewer free tools.  You know what, let me just refer you to others‚Äô rants.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/204423/why_linux_beats_windows_for_servers.html">Five Reasons Linux Beats Windows for Servers</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/linux-foundation-finds-enterprise-linux-growing-at-windows-expense/">Linux Foundation finds enterprise Linux growing at Windows‚Äô expense</a></li>
</ul>

<p>There is a reason 80% (circa 2014) of servers are deployed using Linux, jus‚Äô sayin‚Äô.</p>

<h4 id="c-go-small-and-scale">c. Go Small and Scale</h4>
<p>If you go with Digital Ocean or Linode, they both have reasonable start servers, which can in turn be scaled.  Meaning, you can pay more later for additional server resources without having to completely rebuild your server.</p>

<p>Ok!  For this article I‚Äôm going to use Linode.  I like them.  They‚Äôve who I started with and was extremely happy with their quality and reliability.</p>

<h2 id="3-get-a-server">3. Get a Server</h2>

<p>Head over to</p>

<p><a href="https://linode.com">Linode</a></p>

<p>And <code class="highlighter-rouge">Sign Up</code></p>

<p><img src="../images/sign_up_lindode.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Login, then go to <code class="highlighter-rouge">Add Linode</code>.  Here select the smallest sized Linode as possible.  When I started, the small servers were $5 a month‚Äìbut it looks like they‚Äôve gone up.  My guess is, you can find them on sale occasionally.</p>

<p><img src="../images/smallest_linode_server.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>You don‚Äôt have to select the smallest‚Äìbut I think it‚Äôs plenty for a Jekyll blog.</p>

<p>Once you‚Äôve selected the size of server, scroll to the bottom and select a location central to your audience.  If there isn‚Äôt one, then simply select the location closet to you.</p>

<p>Then select <code class="highlighter-rouge">Add this Linode!</code></p>

<p><img src="../images/set_location_add_linode.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Once you‚Äôve added your Linode you will be re-directed to your Linodes dashboard</p>

<p>Notice, the <code class="highlighter-rouge">IP Address</code> is the IP address of your very first server! Waahoo!</p>

<p><img src="../images/linode_dashboard.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>It‚Äôll take it a second, but the status of your linode should change from <code class="highlighter-rouge">Being created</code> to <code class="highlighter-rouge">Brand new</code>, when it does, you will be ready for the fun!</p>

<h2 id="6-setup-linux">6. Setup Linux</h2>

<p>Let‚Äôs get Linux setup on your machine.  Click on the name of your Linode.</p>

<p><img src="../images/your_linode_name.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>This should load the server dashboard for <em>your</em> server.  Looking something like this.</p>

<p><img src="../images/your_server_dashboard.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Don‚Äôt be alarmed.  There is a lot going on here, but we are going to taker it one step at a time.  Don‚Äôt worry, I got you.</p>

<p>First, let‚Äôs tell the computer which manages your server to install Linux on it.  You can do this by going to <code class="highlighter-rouge">Deploy an Image</code></p>

<p><img src="../images/deploy_image.png" alt="" /></p>

<h4 id="beware-ye-stackscripts"><strong>Beware ye Stackscripts!</strong></h4>
<blockquote>
  <p>A stackscript is a Linux script meant for a machine with newly installed Linux.  The script tells the machine to do a bunch of automated setup work to prepare the machine for a particular task.  In our case prepare our machine to be a server.  I‚Äôm not going to show how to use them in this walkthrough.  For a few reasons.  We will learn more setting things up ourselves, and therefore, will be able to maintain it.  Also, I‚Äôve not found a stack which is specifically for Jekyll.  Most of them have a lot of extra stuff we don‚Äôt need.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ok, back to work.  Let‚Äôs fill out our setup request</p>

<p><img src="../images/install_linux.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Be sure to save your password somewhere! Not a lot of ways to recover it.  Once everything is selected hit <code class="highlighter-rouge">Deploy</code></p>

<p>Your server will quickly be formatted and a fresh copy of Ubuntu 16.04 LTS installed.  Oh, and I‚Äôve not mentioned</p>

<h2 id="5-ssh">5. SSH</h2>
<p>SSH stands for secure shell access.  Shell being the command prompt environment which Linux is based.  This is going to be our main way of interacting with the server.  It may feel terse and inhumane, but I strongly encourage you to embrace the command line.  If you do, the powers of Linux will be yours for free.</p>

<p>And besides, I‚Äôm writing this tutorial around it, so you kinda must to keep following along.</p>

<p>Ok, let‚Äôs fire up your machine.  Open up the Linode dashboard and click on your linode‚Äôs name.  At the top right there be a box called <code class="highlighter-rouge">Server Status</code> and it is probably <code class="highlighter-rouge">Powered Off</code>.  Let‚Äôs turn it on by hitting the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Boot</code> button.</p>

<p><img src="../images/boot_up_server.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Wait until the status below shows your linode has fully booted.</p>

<p>Now, I‚Äôm assuming you are using Linux or Mac as your local operating system.  On either, open a terminal and type</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>ssh root@your.ip.number.here
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>And press enter.</p>

<p>You should see something along the lines</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>[ladvien@ladvien ladvien.github.io]$ ssh root@your.ip.number.here
The authenticity of host 'your.ip.number.here (your.ip.number.here)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:ee2BPBSeaZAFbVdpWFj1oHLxdPdGoxCaSRl3lu6u2Fc.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Type <code class="highlighter-rouge">yes</code> and hit enter.</p>

<p>You will then be prompted to enter the password entered as the <code class="highlighter-rouge">root password</code> during the setup phase in the Linode Manager.</p>

<h2 id="6-nginx-setup">6. Nginx Setup</h2>
<p>You are now on your server.  Do you feel a bit like Mr. Robot?  Live the feeling.  And don‚Äôt let anyone give you a hard time for being a shell noob.  Embrace the shell.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm not going to go Linux stuff in detail.  Please refer to more in depth tutorial.  They are all over the Internet.  But, I will point out, the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Tab</code> key works as an auto-complete.  This is the single most important tidbit of working in shell.  Instead of having to type out a long file name, type the first two letters and hit tab.  It‚Äôll try to fill it in for you.</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs start our server setup.</p>

<p>Your server is simply a computer.  But, we are going to install a program your computer which will cause anyone visiting your IP address in the browser to see parts of your file system.  The visitor‚Äôs browser loads information from your file system and, if the files are in a language the browser understands, renders it for the visitor.  These files will be in HTML and CSS produced by Jekyll.</p>

<p>Ok.  The server program we will be using is called <code class="highlighter-rouge">nginx</code>.  It is not the oldest or the most common. But I find its use straightforward and it seems pretty darn fast too.</p>

<p>But first, let‚Äôs update Linux system. At your server‚Äôs command line type.</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>sudo apt-get update
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>And hit enter.  This causes all the repository links to be updated.  The repository links are libraries of Internet addresses telling your computer when it can find free stuff! Everything is swag on Linux.</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs take a second to check something before we start install <code class="highlighter-rouge">nginx</code>.  Open any browser and type your linode‚Äôs ip address in the browser address bar and hit enter.  Most likely, nothing will happen.  The browser is trying to make contact with your server, but there is no program installed on your server to <em>serve</em> the website to a browser.  That‚Äôs what <code class="highlighter-rouge">nginx</code> will do.</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs download <code class="highlighter-rouge">nginx</code> now</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>sudo apt-get install nginx
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It will ask if you want to install <code class="highlighter-rouge">nginx</code> say yes.</p>

<p>Once it‚Äôs installed, let‚Äôs test and make sure it works.</p>

<p>Type</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>nginx
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It should respond with</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>nginx: [emerg] bind() to 0.0.0.0:80 failed (98: Address already in use)
nginx: [emerg] bind() to [::]:80 failed (98: Address already in use)
nginx: [emerg] bind() to 0.0.0.0:80 failed (98: Address already in use)
nginx: [emerg] bind() to [::]:80 failed (98: Address already in use)
nginx: [emerg] bind() to 0.0.0.0:80 failed (98: Address already in use)
nginx: [emerg] bind() to [::]:80 failed (98: Address already in use)
nginx: [emerg] bind() to 0.0.0.0:80 failed (98: Address already in use)
nginx: [emerg] bind() to [::]:80 failed (98: Address already in use)
nginx: [emerg] bind() to 0.0.0.0:80 failed (98: Address already in use)
nginx: [emerg] bind() to [::]:80 failed (98: Address already in use)
nginx: [emerg] still could not bind()
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Great! This means it is installed and working.  We just need to setup <code class="highlighter-rouge">nginx</code> to serve our files on our server address instead of <code class="highlighter-rouge">0.0.0.0:80</code>.</p>

<p>Also, open a browser and type your sever‚Äôs IP address again.  Hit enter.  This time you should see:</p>

<p><img src="../images/welcome_nginx.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Wow, your are now serving an html to the world, for anyone who visits your website.  Pretty cool, eh?  I think so.</p>

<p>Want to see something pretty cool?</p>

<p>Type (note, <em>do not</em> include <code class="highlighter-rouge">sudo</code> here)</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>nano /var/www/html/index.nginx-debian.html
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You should see the content of the html file being served by <code class="highlighter-rouge">nginx</code>.</p>

<p>Change</p>

<p>Then hit <code class="highlighter-rouge">CTRL + O</code>, which should save the file.  Then hit <code class="highlighter-rouge">CTRL + X</code> to exit the <code class="highlighter-rouge">nano</code> editor.</p>

<p>Now, switch back to your browser, go back to your website‚Äôs IP address, and hit refresh.   You should see.</p>

<p><img src="../images/welcome_t0_nginx_jungle.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Not seeing it?  You didn‚Äôt change the <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;title&gt;</code> instead of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;h1&gt;</code>, right?  Ask me how I know that‚Ä¶</p>

<p>Friggin awesome!  Let‚Äôs move on to setting up Nginx, so you can serve your own website.</p>

<p>Linode actually has a <em>great</em> walkthrough on setting up Nginx.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.linode.com/docs/web-servers/nginx/how-to-configure-nginx/">Nginx Setup</a></li>
</ul>

<p>But, for now, are going to stick with the basic <code class="highlighter-rouge">nginx</code> setup.  There will other articles in this series where I show how to edit <code class="highlighter-rouge">nginx</code> to make the website better.</p>

<h2 id="7-jekyll">7. Jekyll</h2>
<p>Let‚Äôs setup Jekyll locally. To follow utilize Jekyll we are going to need to download and install the following programs.</p>

<h4 id="ruby">Ruby</h4>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_(programming_language)">Ruby</a> is programing environment which contains a package manager which we will use a lot called <code class="highlighter-rouge">[gem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RubyGems)</code>.  For example, when we type <code class="highlighter-rouge">gem install cool-program</code> it is the <code class="highlighter-rouge">ruby</code> environment pulling the <code class="highlighter-rouge">cool-program</code> from the Internet and installing it on your machine.</p>

<h4 id="bundler">Bundler</h4>
<p><a href="https://github.com/bundler/bundler">Bundler</a> is a program which helps pull all the dependencies needed to run a program together. As they say in the README, ‚ÄúBundler makes sure Ruby applications run the same code on every machine.‚Äù</p>

<h4 id="git">Git</h4>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git">Git</a> is version control program.  It also has the ability to pull source code off line.  We are going to use it at first to pull a theme off line, but eventually, we will manage your website Jekyll source code with it.</p>

<h4 id="homebrew-mac-only">Homebrew (Mac Only)</h4>
<p><a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a>, often referred to sa Brew, is a program which is like <code class="highlighter-rouge">apt</code> for Linux.  It is a command line tool which lets you pull programs from the Internet and installs them locally.</p>

<p>Ok, let‚Äôs get going</p>

<p>At your local computer‚Äôs terminal type:</p>

<h4 id="linux">Linux</h4>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>sudo apt-get install ruby
gem install jekyll
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="mac">Mac</h4>
<p>To setup Ruby correctly on Mac we are going to install a command line package manager for Mac called <a href="https://brew.sh/">brewed</a>.  This is the equivalent of <code class="highlighter-rouge">apt</code> in Linux.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
brew install ruby
gem install jekyll
gem install bundler
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="8-get-a-jekyll-starter">8. Get a Jekyll Starter</h2>

<p>Jekyll is great for creating websites, but there is a lot of boilerplate.  I found it <em>much</em> easier to clone someone else‚Äôs Jekyll starter site than make my own from scratch.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://jekyllthemes.org/">Jekyll Themes</a></li>
</ul>

<p>For this series we are going to use the <a href="http://aronbordin.com/neo-hpstr-jekyll-theme/">Neo-HPSTR</a> theme.</p>

<p>Open the terminal and pick a directory where you would like to put a copy of your website.  For me, I‚Äôm Linux and will use the home directory.</p>

<p>Now, let‚Äôs download our theme.</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git clone https://github.com/aron-bordin/neo-hpstr-jekyll-theme
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Git clones the <code class="highlighter-rouge">neo-HPSTR</code> theme from the Internet and puts it in a directory called <code class="highlighter-rouge">/neo-hpstr-jekyll-theme</code> Feel free to rename the directory the name of your website.  For example, my directory is called <code class="highlighter-rouge">ladvien.com</code> We are getting to putting this website on-line, just a few more steps.</p>

<h2 id="9-build-the-jekyll-theme">9. Build the Jekyll Theme</h2>

<p>Open your website‚Äôs directory</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>cd neo-hpstr-jekyll-theme
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>And enter</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>bundler install
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>This will pull all the need programs to make this theme build on your computer.  Note, you may be required to enter your password for file access.</p>

<p>Ok, moment of truth. Type</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>bundle exec jekyll build
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>You should see a response similar to</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Configuration file: /home/ladvien/neo-hpstr-jekyll-theme/_config.yml
       Deprecation: The 'gems' configuration option has been renamed to 'plugins'. Please update your config file accordingly.
            Source: /home/ladvien/neo-hpstr-jekyll-theme
       Destination: /home/ladvien/neo-hpstr-jekyll-theme/_site

      Generating...
                    done in 1.103 seconds.
 Auto-regeneration: disabled. Use --watch to enable.
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>But, if you didn‚Äôt get any errors, you should be good.</p>

<p>Breaking this down, we used the <code class="highlighter-rouge">bundler</code> program to execute the <code class="highlighter-rouge">jekyll</code> program.  We passed the <code class="highlighter-rouge">build</code> command to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">jekyll</code> program, which tells <code class="highlighter-rouge">jekyll</code> to take all your jekyll files and compile them into your website.  The <code class="highlighter-rouge">bundler</code> program made sure <code class="highlighter-rouge">jekyll</code> had everything it needed to compile correctly.</p>

<p>In your file explorer, navigate to your website directory and enter the <code class="highlighter-rouge">_site</code> directory.  This directory contains your entire website after compilation.</p>

<p><img src="../images/the_site_folder.png" alt="jekyll_site_folder" /></p>

<p>Open this folder and then double click on the file <code class="highlighter-rouge">index.html</code>.  This should open your website locally in the browser.</p>

<p><img src="../images/local_jekyll.png" alt="jekyll_site_locally" /></p>

<p>But this isn‚Äôt what we want.  Let‚Äôs get it on the webserver we setup.</p>

<p>Open the command prompt and switch directories to your website‚Äôs main directory.  Then, type</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>scp -r _site/*  root@your.website.ip.address:/var/www/html/
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>This should copy all of your compiled website files to your website. Go to your website address and you should see the website on-line! <em>Booyah!</em></p>

<h2 id="10-that-it">10. That It?</h2>
<p><em>Noooooo</em>, this was the bare minimum setup.  Here‚Äôs a list of what I plan to tackle in this series.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Editing the <code class="highlighter-rouge">_config.yml</code> file to customize your theme</li>
  <li>Setup your code on Github</li>
  <li>Adding <code class="highlighter-rouge">SSL</code> encryption</li>
  <li>Tweaking the server to zip assets before sending them to your viewers</li>
  <li>Make the server more secure ‚Äì this is called hardening</li>
  <li>Create a script which will automatically compile Jekyll, send it to <code class="highlighter-rouge">Github</code>, and then copy the compiled files to your website.</li>
</ul>

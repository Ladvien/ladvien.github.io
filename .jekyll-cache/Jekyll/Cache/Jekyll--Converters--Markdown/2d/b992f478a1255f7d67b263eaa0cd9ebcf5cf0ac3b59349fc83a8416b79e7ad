<p>imagesI guess it’s been an I2C weekend.  I found these <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OLED">organic light-emitting diode displays</a> (OLED)images<a href="http://imall.iteadstudio.com/im130625003.html"> </a>imagesat <a href="http://imall.iteadstudio.com/im130625003.html">Itead</a> studio for $5.  images</p>

<p>imagesNifty little buggers.images</p>

<p>They might be small, but their extraordinary contrast and viewing angle more than make up for it.  Plus, I mean, c’mon, they’re $5.  I will say I was a little annoyed that they operate at 3.3v.  And I’m sure this means I’ll be making a small little level converter board for them pretty soon.  I estimate the converter board would be around $1.25, simagestill a good price.images</p>

<p>images imagesimagesSome perks of OLEDs:images</p>

<ol>
  <li>imagesWider viewing angle (i.e., you don’t have to look straight down at it).images</li>
  <li>imagesNo back light, making them flatter and use less power (not a lot less).images</li>
  <li>imagesHigh refresh rate.  The only time I saw a flicker is through my video camera.  And I had delay(10); in my code :) images</li>
  <li>imagesThey are cheap(er?).images</li>
  <li>imagesThey’re the future :) images</li>
</ol>

<p>The only downside that really jumped out at me was the libraries are about 9k flash uploaded.  The 64x64 LMR Bot was around 1k.</p>

<p>imagesWhen I got them I was worried I wouldn’t be able to use them without digging into the <a href="ftp://imall.iteadstudio.com/Graphic_Display/IM130625003_128x64_OLED_Module/DS_SSD1306.pdf">datasheets</a>. But come to find out, they were exactly the same unit as on <a href="http://www.adafruit.com/products/326">Adafruit’s boards</a>.  Sorry, I love you Ada…but…can’t afford $19.50.  Now, maybe if <a href="http://sternlab.org/">Becky Stern</a> came with them.  Erm.  Anyway, with Ada’s excellent guides and software I had the LMR Bot moving around in about 10 minutes.  So, I’ll end up buying something from Ada to monetarily say, “Thank you, love.”images</p>

<p>I know, I know; I’m working on a converter adapter to make tha all those wires go away.</p>

<p>imagesI’m real happy with these little boards :)images</p>

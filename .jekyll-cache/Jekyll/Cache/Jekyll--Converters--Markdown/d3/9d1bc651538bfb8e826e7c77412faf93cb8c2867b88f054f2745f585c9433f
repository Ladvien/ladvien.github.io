<p>I finally got in my Mega Mini Motor (M3) shield that I designed.  I was surprised, after populating the board: It actually worked.  The board came about after making the <a href="http://letsmakerobots.com/node/36273">Arduino Mega Mini</a>.  I noticed I wouldnâ€™t really be reducing the bulk of my <a href="http://letsmakerobots.com/node/35922">bot</a> because of the amount of wiring it would take to get logic to the Arduino Motor Driver shield I was using.  Therefore, I set out to design a motor driver shield that would plug right into the MegaMini.  I broke out Eagle and some datasheets on an assortment of ICs.</p>

<p>I started out working with the L298D chip, but quickly got frustrated with the way it set on the MegaMini footprint.  Plus, the flyback diodes were pissing me off.  I had remembered reading that the <a href="http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/sn754410.pdf">SN754410</a> had internal ESD diodes.  I started playing with the chip layout and got a board design I was pretty happy with.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ll attempt a full write up later;Iâ€™m pretty mentally fatigued from learning html/css (I know, easy.  But as many know by now, cognitively, Iâ€™m as slow as a snail on salt.)</p>

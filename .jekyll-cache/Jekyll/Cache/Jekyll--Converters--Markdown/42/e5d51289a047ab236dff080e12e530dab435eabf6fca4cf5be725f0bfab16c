<p>I decided to try making an Arduino Pro Mini at home.  Being done, it‚Äôs not worth it.  You can buy one for a dollar more than you can make them, and it took awhile to populate.  Although, it‚Äôs ‚Äúfun.‚Äù</p>

<p>This projects was also a chance for me to test the Spying-Stalactite I built.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve enjoyed it.  It allows me to reflect on my strategy while populating boards.  It‚Äôs simply a drop down with some high-powered LEDs (~2500 lumen), heatsink, and coolant fan.  It has a hole for my iphone to do the recording.  Cheap and simple.  Although, I need to diffuse the light, as you might see by the video that it washes out the details of the projects.  Also, I‚Äôll add a few more lights and do away with the tungsten lamp, since the iphone is constantly in a white-balance battle as I move infront of the mixed lightsources.</p>

<p>I populated this board; everything came out fine (although, it was <em>much more difficult</em> trying not to block the camera with my head).  I popped it into Atmel studio and it read out the device voltage and signature.  Of course, I bricked it, as I seem to do a lot.</p>

<p>My next projects is a Fuse Doctor. :)</p>

<p>I had ordered the boards from OSHPark and had planned on making three.  So, I populated another and took some time programming it.  I‚Äôve outlined my steps below:</p>

<p><strong>1. Hook up the AVRISP MKII</strong></p>

<p><img src="../images/avrispmkii-pin-out.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><img src="../images/Pinout_of_Aduino_Pro_Mini.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>2. Open Atmel Studio.  Go to Tools ‚Äì Device Programming.</strong></p>

<p><strong>3. Setup:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Tool: AVRISP mkII</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Device: ATmega328P</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Interface: ISP</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Click apply</strong></p>

<p><strong>4. Read Target voltage (it should be ~5V).  Read Device Signature.</strong></p>

<p><strong><img src="../images/Atmel_Studio_1.jpg" alt="" /></strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Open <strong>boards.txt</strong> that comes with Arduino (\Desktop\arduino-1.0.3\hardware\arduino\boards.txt).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Scroll down to the area marked:</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><img src="../images/Boards_File.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>8. Pull the programming information for the board from this area.</strong>  Now, I‚Äôve bricked a few boards, but I think I‚Äôve figured this one out.  When programming this board with the MKII and Atmel Studio, you should follow this order.</p>

<p><strong>1. Set the fuses:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Extended: 0xFD</strong></li>
  <li><strong>High: 0xDA</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Low: 0xFF</strong></li>
  <li><strong>(Double check the board file to make sure I didn‚Äôt make typos)</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Hit ‚ÄúProgram‚Äù</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>2. Upload Bootloader.</strong></p>

<p>‚ÄúThe bootloader for the 5v, 16mhz Arduino Pro Mini (which is what I built) is ‚ÄúATmegaBOOT_168_atmega328.hex (Desktop\arduino-1.0.3\hardware\arduino\bootloaders\atmega\ATmegaBOOT_168_atmega328.hex).<br />
<strong>It‚Äôs important to note that the 3.3v and 5v versions use different bootloaders.</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Go to the Memories tab</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Hit the browse ellipsis.</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Select the ‚ÄúATmegaBOOT_168_atmega328.hex‚Äù</strong></li>
  <li><strong>(Double check the boards file to make sure I‚Äôm not screwing you up).</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Hit program.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3  Set Lock Bits.</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Go to the ‚ÄúLock bits‚Äù tab.</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Check the boards.txt file for Lockbit number</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Lockbit: 0xCF</strong></li>
  <li><strong>(Double check the boards.txt.  I don‚Äôt take blame for bricked boards :P).</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Hit ‚ÄúProgram‚Äù</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>9 Upload the Blink Sketch; the LED by the reset button should blink.</strong></p>

<p><strong>10 Let me know how it went.  If you bricked a chip using these instructions, let me know so I can modify them quick.</strong></p>

<p>Now that I‚Äôm used to the camera and stalactite, I plan to annotate my next board for tips on working with 0402s.</p>

<p>Hope all are well.</p>

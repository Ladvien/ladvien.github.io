I"»<p>Hello! My name is Thomas Brittain.  Iâ€™m a professional data analyst at Bitfocus. I spend a lot of free time exploring the world of physical computing and machine learning.</p>

<p>As a former homeless street outreach specialist, I had an atypical entrance into the machine learning world. But as a result Iâ€™m dedicated to seeing these nifty new models applied to socially significant problems.</p>

<p>As a community-taught developer, Iâ€™m also a passionate learner, solver of problems, and teacher. Iâ€™ve designed many machine learning models, circuits, and robots (some have even worked). I live in Fort Worth, TX with my three favorite neural-nets in training: Bek, Silas, and Echo.</p>

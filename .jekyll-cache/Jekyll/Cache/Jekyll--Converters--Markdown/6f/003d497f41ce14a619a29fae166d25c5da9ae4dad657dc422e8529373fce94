<p>UPDATE: August 10th, 2014</p>

<p>I printed a body and added BLE.  I‚Äôll explain tomorrow after I get some rest, but the BLE was to allow me to test directed locomotion.  I‚Äôve also done some feature testing (load-sharing, charging circuit, ‚Äúhunger‚Äù ADC), the board is actually a good design.  Works well.</p>

<p>The BLE is the HM-11, itty-bitty BLE.</p>

<p>My goal is to test the physical and feature designs with the ATtiny84, and when Mr. Bdk6 releases his toolchain for the LPC1114, switch it as the controlling chip.</p>

<p>This is my version of Yahmez‚Äô <a href="http://letsmakerobots.com/node/39306">Baby Bot</a>, the ATtiny84 Y-Baby (YB84).  There are few differences from Yahmez‚Äô version.</p>

<ol>
  <li>This version uses an ATtiny84.</li>
  <li>It uses a LIR2032.</li>
  <li>It has a charge circuit built in, using the MCP73831.  This circuit has load-sharing capability so the baby can ‚Äúfeed‚Äù without sleeping.</li>
  <li>The YB84 has two LED indicators.</li>
  <li>One pin on the YB84 monitors the battery voltage, so it can tell how ‚Äúhungry‚Äù it is.</li>
</ol>

<p>This version came about because Yahmez‚Äô Baby Bots were so damn cool I had to copy them.  Here‚Äôs the <a href="http://letsmakerobots.com/node/39650">node</a> where I asked permission and added design notes.  Also, I‚Äôve wanted to make a small, cheap, small robot to couple with my <a href="http://letsmakerobots.com/node/38883">Overlord</a> projects in hope to develop an electronic lab-rat.</p>

<p>Here is the BOM:</p>

</ol>

<p>Note, I‚Äôve not included the IR receiver or IR transmitters in the BOM.  I‚Äôve not tested the circuit yet, or sourced cheap parts.  But I‚Äôm shooting to keep them under $10.</p>

<p>YB84 BOM Total: $7.70</p>

<p>Really, there wasn‚Äôt much to developing this little guy, Yahmez had done all the work.  I simply selected an Atmel uC that I felt was cheap enough and provided enough pins to accomplish what I wanted to do with the little guy.  The one problem I had was with the <a href="http://blog.zakkemble.co.uk/a-lithium-battery-charger-with-load-sharing/#comment-54494">load-sharing circuit</a> I tried to copy from Zak Kemble.</p>

<p>When I went to layout the load-circuit my mind got locked on the old thought, ‚ÄúMOSFET diodes go against the current.‚Äù  This caused me to lay the DMP1045U down backwards, which essentially shorts the battery.<a href="http://blog.zakkemble.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/MCP73831_loadshare.png"><img src="../images/Drop_Charger_Notes_1.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>This took me a bit to figure out.  I apparently wasn‚Äôt the only one that made the mistake, as a comment on Zak‚Äôs blog had a fellow asking my questions for me.  In the end, I got the circuit sorted out and now the little guy works as intended.</p>

<p>That‚Äôs about it for now.  I still have lots of testing to do on the little guy.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Motor placement for correct movements.</li>
  <li>Leg angling for correct gait.</li>
  <li>IR-RX circuit.</li>
  <li>IR-TX circuit.</li>
</ol>

<p>Currently, I have a pogo-pin programming header.  But it is <em>imperative</em> to accomplish my goals for this little guy to make him programmable via IR.  This should allow me to program a swarm of these little guys without manual interaction.  I know the Kilotbot projects modified the Arduino code to do this very thing.  My ideal setup is to add a mobile hanging over a swarm of these guys.  On this mobile would be: IR-TX, IR-RX, and a camera.   The camera would be using <a href="http://letsmakerobots.com/node/38883">Overlord</a> to track these guys and the IR to communicate with them in mass.</p>

<p>As always, thoughts, opinions, and critiques I welcome :)</p>

## HM-1X Aid Overview

Well, I've had the urge to hack.  It's been strong for awhile now, sadly, with a more than fullt-time job and Bek in graduate school, I've just had no time.  **Until now!**  The new job I have (HMIS Database Manager) has _actual_ vacation time.  I've had almost two weeks off (combined with the Christmas holiday).  The first few days were obviously spent working...**But!** After turning my phone and email (the work email) I was able to...catch up on family time.  Sigh.  Then, clean house.  Then, get bored.  But with a few days left I actually got some hacking in.

I downloaded Visual Studio Express on my work computer a few months ago.  (Shh.  Don't tell the boss.) But I've not had time to write a single line of code.  This holiday was a good time to learn C\#!

Two weeks later I had this monster,

It is meant to be a GUI for the HM-10, HM-11, and HM-15 modules.  The highlights,

1. It uses threads to prevent any "Sleeping."  Keeps the UI healthy.
2. IO.SerialPorts _should_ allow a lot of USB-to-UART chips to work.
3. Basic Terminal App features (view as ASCII, HEC, Decimal, etc.) like RealTerm and the others. BUT! With one feature I've longed for in a terminal app for so damn long.  The ability to save your settings on exit.  No more selecting 9600 baud for the billionth time.
4. I've put a lot of command validity checks in the system.  For example, if you were to type "AT+CON0123**S**6789012" Would not be a valid command normally, but terminal will convert the "S" to "F."
5. I have also imbued it with a bit my understanding of the HM-1X datasheets.  This is probably the greatest selling point of the program, sadly.
6. **C# is my new favorite.  Don't judge me :P.**

I thought I would take some time to go into the code involved in the little terminal, not for posterity, merely for my own reference.

**"Attention .NET Users! This is the law. Disperse immediately, or we will use lethal force to clear the area. You have been warned. You now have 20 seconds to comply..."**

One last note, I started porting this to Mac and Linux using MonoDevelopment, but it would require writing my own interrupt handler.  Or faking it with a timeout method.  Nether option is worth it to me.  Too many other projects and too little time.

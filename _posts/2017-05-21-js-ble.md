# From Metal to JavaScript

I've never programmed anything in JavaScript.  For the most part, I stay away from web development like herpes.  However, I've recently been under pressure from my day job.  It has lead top eyeing positions in the developer world, and sadly, if one doesn't know how to do simple webdevelopment, there doesn't seem to be much need for their skills.

With that, I'm taking several courses from Udemy:

1. The Complete JavaScript Course
2. JavaScript: The Weird Parts
3. The Web Developer Bootcamp

All seem to be worth the $10 I've spent.  However, I was struggling trying to find a project that'd interest me enough to practice.  That's when I discovered Google's Web API which has a framwork which allows for interaction with Bluetooth LE devices from inside the browser!  Now I've got some projects.

Well, so far, so good.  I've been able to connect to the TinySafeBoot loader on an ATtiny84 via the HM-11 BLE module.

Below is a sample of the project.  Currently, it is merely a BLE serial terminal--but I'll attempt to develop it into a TinySafeBootloader, like my C# projects.

{% include lumi-communication-js.html %}




## js-ble.js ## 

This is the main app.js

{% highlight javascript %}
    {% include /snippets/js-ble/lumi-comm-ble.js %}
{% endhighlight %}


Below is the module which controls the Bluetooth LE functions.

{% highlight javascript %}
    {% include /snippets/js-ble/lumi-comm-ble.js %}
{% endhighlight %}


Here is the Terminal module.  This is meant to encapsulate the code responsible for displaying the sent, received, and system information.

{% highlight javascript %}
    {% include /snippets/js-ble/terminal.js %}
{% endhighlight %}

Below is the TinySafeBoot module:

{% highlight javascript %}
    {% include /snippets/js-ble/tinysafeboot.js %}
{% endhighlight %}


And the HTML for the terminal

{% highlight html %}
    {% include /snippets/js-ble/lumi-communication-js.html %}
{% endhighlight %}

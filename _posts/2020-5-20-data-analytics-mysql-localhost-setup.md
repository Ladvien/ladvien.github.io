The last two articles have been getting oriented to SQL, however, the information in them will disappear quickly if we don't give you a way to practice on data meaningful to you.  Let's face it, as much fun as it is to find out random employees salaries, those don't mean anything to _you_.  

This article will show you how to setup a copy of MySQL Server on your PC, connect to it, load data from a CSV, and query those data.  There's a lot to get done, so let's get started.

# Local MySQL Server Setup
Each of the three operating systems are a little different on how you must go about setting up a local copy of MySQL Server.  Unfortunately, Windows is the most complex.  Anyway, feel free to skip to the appropriate section

* Windows
* Max
* Linux

## Windows
First, download the MySQL MSI Installer.

* [MySQL Windows Installer](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/)

After you've downloaded it, open the the file.

If you are prompted to "Upgrade" go ahead and say "Yes"

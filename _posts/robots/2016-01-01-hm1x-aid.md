Well, I've had the urge to hack.  It's been strong for awhile now, sadly, with a more than fullt-time job and Bek in graduate school, I've just had no time.  **Until now!**  The new job I have (HMIS Databse Manager) has _actual_ vacation time.  I've had almost two weeks off (combined with the Christmas holiday).  The first few days were obviously spent working...**But!** After turning my phone and email (the work email) I was able to...catch up on family time.  Sigh.  Then, clean house.  Then, get bored.  But with a few days left I actually got some hacking time in.

I downloaded Visual Studio Express on my work computer a few months ago.  (Shh.  Don't tell the boss.) But I've not had the time to write a singel line of code.  This holiday was a good time to learn C#!

Two weeks later I had this monster,

It is meant to be a GUI for the HM-10, HM-11, and HM-15 modules.  The highlights,

1\. It uses threads to prevent any "Sleeping."  Keeps the UI healthy.
2\. IO.SerialPorts _should_ allow a lot of USB-to-UART chips to work.
3\. Basic Terminal App features (view as ASCII, HEC, Decimal, etc.) like RealTerm and the others. BUT! With one feature I've longed for in a terminal app for so damn long.  The ability to save your settings on exit.  No more selecting 9600 baud for the billionth time.

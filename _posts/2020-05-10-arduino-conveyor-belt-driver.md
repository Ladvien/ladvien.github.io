This article is part of a series documenting an attempt to create a LEGO sorting machine.  This portion covers the Arduino Mega2560 firmware I've written to control a RAMPS 1.4 stepper motor board.

## Goal
To move forward with the LEGO sorting machine I needed a way to drive a conveyor belt.  Stepper motors were a fairly obvious choice.  They provide plenty of torque and finite control.  Of course, one of the overall goals of this project is to keep the tools accessible.  After some research I decided to meet both goals by purchasing an Ardunio / RAMPs combo package intended for 3D printers.

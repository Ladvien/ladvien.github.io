I work with a lot of data on the behalf of an agency without a lot of money.  Exploring free-to-use and open-source tools is key to being effective in my job.

Recently, I've written a a couple of series on how to use R and SQL to sort through Homeless Management Information System data.  

* [HMIS, R, and SQL](https://ladvien.com/hmis-r-sql-introduction/)
* [HMIS SQL-R Script Snippets](https://ladvien.com/attachment-iii-aka-the-zombie/)

These data are essential to local governments helping individuals experiencing homelessness be housed quickly and appropriately.

But one area I've felt R and SQL have not help is delivering on-line interactive dashboards.  Data is one thing, but easy to digest information is really key to informing stakeholders how the system is working to end homelessness.

In other projects I've attempted to generate graphs as image and upload those to a static link.  Then, each time the data change re-generate teh image and replace it.  But, most website servers cache the images so it is not ideal.

This has pushed me to learn JavaScript and to use D3.  

* [D3.js](https://d3js.org/)

I'm not going to lie, I've felt confused by languages, IDEs, and libraries.  And I've overcome most of the confusion.  But I've never been confused by the layout and syntax of D3.

The dyslexic feeling I get trying to work in D3 has discouraged me from spending too much time.

But recently I decided to take another stab at it--and this time I lucked out and found the C3.js.

* [C3.js](http://c3js.org/)

Essentially, C3 is a library which _greatly_ simplifies D3.  Essentially, it boils down building a graph into a simple JSON file.

For example,

This code:

{% highlight javascript %}
var chart = c3.generate({
    data: {
        x: 'Date',
        y: '# Individuals',
        xFormat: '%Y-%m-%d',
        url: 'https://ladvien.com/projects/d3/data/trendsInTX601.csv',
        type: 'line',
        // colors: {
        //     Count: '#990000'
        // }
        names: {
            NumberHomeless: "Homeless",
            NumberInRRH: "Rapid Rehousing",
            NumberInPSH: "Permanent Supportive Housing"
        }
    },
    
    title: {
        text: "Homeless or Formerly Homeless in TX-601"
    },

    legend: {
        show: true
    },

    axis: {
        x: {
            type: 'timeseries',
            tick: {
                count: 4,
                format: '%Y-%m-%d',
                // rotate: 90,
                multiline: false,
                
                culling: {
                    max:5 
                }
            }
        },
        y: {
            max: 3000,
            min: 0,
            label: "# Individuals"
            // Range includes padding, set 0 if no padding needed
            // padding: {top:0, bottom:0}
        },
    },
    
    point: {
        r: 0
    }
});
{% endhighlight %}

Using this CSV:

* [trendsInTX601.csv](https://ladvien.com/projects/d3/data/trendsInTX601.csv)

Produces the following graph:

<p>UPDATE: Added BOM corrections. (Sorry for floating.)</p>

<p>Ok. Here’s a finished board I’ve been working on for a bit.</p>

<p>In essence, it is a BLE node board.  It combines an HM-10 board with an ATtiny 85.  This board builds off:</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="http://letsmakerobots.com/node/38009">Bluetooth 4.0 (HM-10) </a></li>
  <li><a href="http://letsmakerobots.com/node/39130">ATtiny 85</a></li>
</ol>

<p>The idea of the Bitsy Spider board is diminutive controller node.  I wanted it to be cheap and versatile enough to use as a node, but I think the final price is around $11 each.</p>

<p>Here’s the ole GitHub:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/Ladvien/HM-10">ATtiny Bitsy Spider</a> (v.02)</li>
</ul>

<p>The BOM:</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="http://www.oshpark.com/shared_projectss/dTdbdJec">OSHPark Board</a>: $1.68 each ($5.05 minimum).</li>
  <li>1 x 20k Resistor – 0402: $.04</li>

</ol>

<p>Total (approximate): <strong>$10.55</strong></p>

<p>There are lots of solder-jumpers on this board, given it is meant to be versatile.</p>

<p>Here is the programming pinout to use an Arduino as ISP</p>

<p><img src="../images/Incy_Blue.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><img src="../images/Attiny_Bitsy_Spider_--_Solder_Jumpers_for_TX-RX.jpg" alt="" />The board is intended to harness the serial connection of the HM-10.  In this version I made it straight forward, you leave the jumpers between the RX/TX line of the HM-10 and the ATtiny unsoldered, program the ATtiny as many times as you like.  To test your serial connection between the ATtiny and the HM-10 simply breadboard the PCB and put jumpers like so:</p>

<p><strong>PB0 &lt;—&gt; TX</strong></p>

<p>** PB1 &lt;—&gt; RX**</p>

<p>This will allow you to test your code, without having to solder and unsolder.  Then, after your code is perfectish, solder the jumpers marked “PB1 &amp; HM10 RX” and “PB0 &amp; HM10 TX,” then embed the Bitsy Spider.</p>

<p><img src="../images/Attiny_Bitsy_Spider_--_Solder_Jumpers_for_Always_On.jpg" alt="" />This is an option that’ll probably continue throughout different versions of the board.  I ran the GND connection of the ATtiny through a N-Chan MOSFET, and tied the gate of the FET to the PIO1.  The PIO1 pin of the HM-10’s function is for a Connection Status LED.  But one of the options one can set on the HM-10 is for the PIO1 to stay low unless the HM-10 has a connection.  This can be set on the HM-10 when it’s in AT mode by typing:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Type: <strong>AT+PIO11</strong></li>
  <li>Response: OK+PIO11</li>
</ol>

<p>When done, the ATtiny 85 will only power-up if the HM-10 has a connection.  Of course, the solder-jumper is meant to bypass this feature.</p>

<p><img src="../images/Attiny_Bitsy_Spider_--_Solder_Jumpers_for_ATtiny_Reset_Control.jpg" alt="" />The last solder jumper controls the HM-10’s reset.  If soldered, the ATtiny 85 can reset the HM-10 by sending PB4 high for ~100mS.  I added this as I hope to create a star-network with the ATtiny Bitsy Spider.</p>

<p>Here’s a summary explanation; the HM-10 has a time out feature after it losses connection from one HM-10 that prevents it from connecting to another for approximately 10 seconds.  So far, there is no option to bypass this “lost connection” time-out.  But resetting the HM-10 (&lt;150mS power-cycle) bypasses this time-out.  I’ll update more on this setup when I’ve completely tested it.  If there are questions, I’ve written a lot in the comments of my original <a href="http://letsmakerobots.com/node/38009">HM-10 post</a>.  But also feel fre to contact me.</p>

<p>One last thing I should mention.</p>

<p>I expect one major mistake and two minors on the first run of every board I send off.  This board is no exception.  I forgot the decoupling capacitors on the voltage regulator and the HM-10.  I’ve added them on the v.02 board.  Of course, this shouldn’t be a major flaw, but with a capacitor on the voltage regulator it causes it to spit out 3.6v instead of 3.3v.  Major problem.  I saved this set of boards by soldering a 0402 1uF between the legs of the SOT-23-5 regulator.  Not fancy, but saved $5.</p>

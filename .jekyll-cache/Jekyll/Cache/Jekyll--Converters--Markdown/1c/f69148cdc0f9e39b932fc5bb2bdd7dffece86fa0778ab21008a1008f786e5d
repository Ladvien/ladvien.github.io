<p>This project takes brain wave readings from a MindWave Mobile 2+, transmits them to an iOS app via Bluetooth LE.  The iOS app makes  calls to a remote Node server, which is a minimal REST API, passing off the brain wave sample.  The Node server stores the data on a MongoDB server.  The MongoDB server is then exposed to business intelligence applications use with MongoDB BI Connector.  Lastly, using Tableau Professional Desktop, the data is accessed and visualizations created.</p>

<p>Whew.</p>

<p>To recap:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14758">MindWave Mobile 2+</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/Ladvien/MindWaveJournaler">iOS App</a> (tentatively named Mind Wave Journaler; Swift)</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/Ladvien/mind-wave-journal-server">REST Server</a> (mind-wave-journaler; NodeJS)</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.mongodb.com/products/bi-connector">MongoDB BI Connector Server</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.tableau.com/products/desktop">Tableau Desktop Professional</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The end result is a system which could allow a remote EEG analyst to examine samples nearly in real time.</p>

<p>Below, Iâ€™m going to show how I was able to setup the system.  But, before that a few words of warning.</p>

<h2 id="gotchas">Gotchas</h2>

<h3 id="hacker-haters">Hacker Haters</h3>
<p>This isnâ€™t a hacker friendly project.  It relies on several paid licenses, an Apple Developer License ($99) and Tableau Desktop Professional ($10,000,000,000 or something).  Of course, the central piece of hardware, the MindWave Mobile, is also $99, but I think that one is fair.  Oh! Letâ€™s not forget, even though you bought an Apple Developer license, you still need a Mac (or Hackintosh) to compile the app.</p>

<p>However, as a proof-of-concept, I think itâ€™s solid.  Hopefully a good hacker will be able to see how several tweaks in the system could make it <em>dirt</em> cheap to deploy.</p>

<h3 id="mimimum-viable-hacker-product">Mimimum Viable Hack..er, Product</h3>
<p>The source code provided here is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product">minimally viable</a>.  Fancy words meaning, only <em>base</em> functionality was implemented.  There many other things which could be done to improve each piece of the system.</p>

<p>Not to be a douche, but please donâ€™t point them out.  Thatâ€™s the only thing I ask for providing this <em>free</em> information.</p>

<p>There are many improvements I know can be made.  The reason they were not made had nothing to do with my ignorance (well, at least a majority of them), but rather my time constraints.</p>

<h3 id="i-hate-tableau">I Hate Tableau</h3>
<p>Thatâ€™s it.  I hate Tableau.</p>

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>

<p>Letâ€™s make a list of whatâ€™s needed before beginning this project.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Mac (to compile the iOS app)</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14758">MindWave Mobile 2+</a></li>
  <li>A remote server running Ubuntu 16.04 (theoretically a local server will work, but youâ€™ll be on your own)</li>
  <li><a href="https://developer.apple.com/programs/">Apple Developer License</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/">Xcode</a>, with Swift 4.1</li>
  <li><a href="https://cocoapods.org/">CocoaPods</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-ubuntu/">MongoDB</a> Running on Ubuntu</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.mongodb.com/products/bi-connector">MongoDB BI Connector Server</a></li>
  <li>A business intelligence platform with remote connection ability</li>
</ul>

<p>Regarding the business intelligence platformâ€“if anyone has a <em>free</em> suggestions, please leave them in the comments below.  The first improvement Iâ€™d like to the entire system is to get away from Tableau.  Have I mentioned I hate it?</p>

<p>Ok, letâ€™s get started!</p>

**Addendum:** _Please don't watch my videos._  After Birdmun's comment I found Hack-a-Day has created better videos (shakes fist at Hack-a-Day) and I don't want anyone to waste anyone's time.  Although, mine has a better soundtrack and less mutton-chops :)

Hack-a-Day videos:

1.  [Learning Eagle CAD Part 1 -- Schematic & Custom Parts](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=irE4oHB5fSc)
2.  [Learning Eagle CAD Part 2 -- Schematic & Custom Parts](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=ZIJ1tml7rVU) (includes making a part)
3.  [Learning Eagle CAD -- CAM Processor](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=yJQUImv-gq8)

**Original:** I was speaking with TeleFox and Birdmun about finding an optoisolator for use with my Raspberry Pi; I had gotten some samples of these ICs: [ADUM1250ARZ](http://www.analog.com/static/imported-files/data_sheets/ADUM1250_1251.pdf).  Well, for awhile now I've wanted to share my dumb-luck methods for designing a board around a sampled IC.

So here it is, 20mins (sorry).

Hope everyone is well :)
